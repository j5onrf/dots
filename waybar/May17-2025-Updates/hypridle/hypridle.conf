# Description for hypridle.conf
#
# This is a minimalist hypridle configuration designed for simple and predictable power management without automatic screen locking.
#
# It creates a three-stage idle process: after a period of inactivity, it first turns off the display, and then after a much
# longer period, it suspends the system. It explicitly disables all automatic locking features, giving the user full manual
# control over when to lock their session.
#

general {
    # lock_cmd = pidof hyprlock || hyprlock       # avoid starting multiple hyprlock instances.
    # lock_cmd = playerctl --all-players pause && pidof hyprlock || hyprlock  # pause all system audio and avoid starting multiple hyprlock instances.
    # before_sleep_cmd = loginctl lock-session    # lock before suspend.
    after_sleep_cmd = hyprctl dispatch dpms on  # to avoid having to press a key twice to turn on the display.
}

listener {
    timeout = 1800                                 # 30min
    # on-timeout = loginctl lock-session            # lock screen when timeout has passed
}

# The other listeners handle dpms (screen off/on) and suspend, they don't directly call hyprlock
# but the suspend might trigger the lock if before_sleep_cmd was active.
